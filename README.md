Hi Joanna,
I talked to Mike Freeman about turning in this assignment late because a lot was going on last week for me.
We agreed that instead of losing 10% per day late, I would lose 10% per school day late.
So for Friday, Monday, and Tuesday that would add up to a 30% deduction.

--------------------------
1. I worked alone
2. No advanced features
3. 20 hours
4. I had trouble figuring out how to view my data on parse. The rest of the time was just a struggle to figure things out
